# Assembly Programming Examples for PICDEM BOARD 2

Welcome to the Assembly Programming Examples repository for PICDEM BOARD 2 with microcontroller PIC18F45K20 and P18F4525. This repository is designed to provide demonstration and learning resources for assembly programming targeting these specific microcontrollers.

## Introduction

This repository contains a collection of programs written in assembly language. Each program is designed to demonstrate different concepts and functionalities of assembly programming. Whether you're a beginner looking to understand the basics or an advanced user seeking to explore more complex algorithms, these examples aim to provide a comprehensive learning experience.

## Programs Included

1. **Addition and Subtraction (32-bit)**
   - Demonstrates addition and subtraction operations on 32-bit numbers.

2. **Multiplication and Division (16-bit)**
   - Illustrates multiplication and division operations on 16-bit numbers.

3. **Sorting (Selection Sort Algorithm)**
   - Implements the selection sort algorithm to sort an array of elements.

4. **Moving Average**
   - Calculates the moving average of a set of data points.

5. **Software and Hardware UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver-Transmitter)**
   - Implements UART communication using both software and hardware methods.

6. **I2C Communication with EEPROM**
   - Demonstrates Inter-Integrated Circuit (I2C) communication with an EEPROM (Electrically Erasable Programmable Read-Only Memory).

## Requirements

To run these programs, you will need:
- PICDEM BOARD 2
- Microcontroller PIC18F45K20 or P18F4525
- Appropriate development environment (e.g., MPLAB X IDE)

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.

2. Open the desired program file in your assembly development environment (e.g., MPLAB X IDE).

3. Build and program the microcontroller with the selected assembly program.

4. Run the program on the PICDEM BOARD 2 and observe the results.
